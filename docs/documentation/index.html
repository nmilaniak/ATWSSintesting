				<h3>Docs, Documents, Documentation</h3>
				<p>When working on a big project, like ATWSS, there are always many documents considering the software, hardware, maintenance and other necessary components, which create a whole. In order to make it easier for the users but also for people, who will maybe work on it later in the process, it is essential to create a full documentation on every step of the way. To make sure everything is clear.</p>
